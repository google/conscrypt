/**
 * Our additional application data needed for getting synchronization right.
 * This maybe warrants a bit of lengthy prose:
 *
 * (1) We use a flag to reflect whether we consider the SSL connection alive.
 * Any read or write attempt loops will be cancelled once this flag becomes 0.
 *
 * (2) We use an int to count the number of threads that are blocked by the
 * underlying socket. This may be at most two (one reader and one writer), since
 * the Java layer ensures that no more threads will enter the native code at the
 * same time.
 *
 * (3) The pipe is used primarily as a means of cancelling a blocking select()
 * when we want to close the connection (aka "emergency button"). It is also
 * necessary for dealing with a possible race condition situation: There might
 * be cases where both threads see an SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
 * SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE. Both will enter a select() with the proper argument.
 * If one leaves the select() successfully before the other enters it, the
 * "success" event is already consumed and the second thread will be blocked,
 * possibly forever (depending on network conditions).
 *
 * The idea for solving the problem looks like this: Whenever a thread is
 * successful in moving around data on the network, and it knows there is
 * another thread stuck in a select(), it will write a byte to the pipe, waking
 * up the other thread. A thread that returned from select(), on the other hand,
 * knows whether it's been woken up by the pipe. If so, it will consume the
 * byte, and the original state of affairs has been restored.
 *
 * The pipe may seem like a bit of overhead, but it fits in nicely with the
 * other file descriptors of the select(), so there's only one condition to wait
 * for.
 *
 * (4) Finally, a mutex is needed to make sure that at most one thread is in
 * either SSL_read() or SSL_write() at any given time. This is an OpenSSL
 * requirement. We use the same mutex to guard the field for counting the
 * waiting threads.
 *
 * Note: The current implementation assumes that we don't have to deal with
 * problems induced by multiple cores or processors and their respective
 * memory caches. One possible problem is that of inconsistent views on the
 * "aliveAndKicking" field. This could be worked around by also enclosing all
 * accesses to that field inside a lock/unlock sequence of our mutex, but
 * currently this seems a bit like overkill. Marking volatile at the very least.
 *
 * During handshaking, additional fields are used to up-call into
 * Java to perform certificate verification and handshake
 * completion. These are also used in any renegotiation.
 *
 * (5) the JNIEnv so we can invoke the Java callback
 *
 * (6) a NativeCrypto.SSLHandshakeCallbacks instance for callbacks from native to Java
 *
 * (7) a java.io.FileDescriptor wrapper to check for socket close
 *
 * We store the ALPN protocols list so we can either send it (from the server) or
 * select a protocol (on the client). We eagerly acquire a pointer to the array
 * data so the callback doesn't need to acquire resources that it cannot
 * release.
 *
 * Because renegotiation can be requested by the peer at any time,
 * care should be taken to maintain an appropriate JNIEnv on any
 * downcall to openssl since it could result in an upcall to Java. The
 * current code does try to cover these cases by conditionally setting
 * the JNIEnv on calls that can read and write to the SSL such as
 * SSL_do_handshake, SSL_read, SSL_write, and SSL_shutdown.
