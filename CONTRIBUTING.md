# How to contribute

We definitely welcome patches and contributions to Conscrypt! Here are some
guideline and information about how to do so.

## Before getting started

In order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).

We follow the [Clang Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
There is support in most IDEs.

If planning on making a large change, feel free to [create an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/conscrypt/issues/new) or send an
email to [conscrypt@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/conscrypt) to discuss
beforehand.

## Proposing changes

Make sure that `./gradlew build` (`gradlew build` on Windows) completes
successfully without any new warnings (see [Building](BUILDING.md)). Then create a Pull Request
with your changes. When the changes are accepted, they will be merged or cherry-picked by
a Conscrypt developer.
